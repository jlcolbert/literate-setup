* Do I have to use Emacs?
No, but that's what I know how to set up.
You can also use Jupyter notebooks;
however, those are primarily for Python.
You can install all kernels, but I don't know if they are as extensive as the ones for Emacs and Org Mode.

RMarkdown is another wonderful option if you write a lot of R code!

* Where can I see some examples of yours?
You can view my:
